# eMDocs - embedded Markdown documentation tool

*This is version **0.1.0**.*

**eMDocs** is a very simple documentation generator which lives between plain
Markdown files and tools like [JSDoc] and [Sphinx]. It doesn't try to understand
the code itself, it merely finds blocks of Markdown documentation in the source
tree and uses it to build HTML documentation.

## Why?

I use [JSDocs] and [Sphinx] where appropriate, but often find they are too
heavy, complex, or time-consuming when I want to whip up documentation for a
project, and don't need all the neat-o features they provide. Sometimes, I just
want to write some notes inside the code, and maybe a couple `.md` files to tie
it all together. Hence, **eMDocs**.
